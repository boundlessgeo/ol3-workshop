OpenLayers Resources
====================

The OpenLayers library contains a wealth of functionality. Though the developers have worked hard to provide examples of that functionality and have organized the code in a way that allows other experienced developers to find their way around, many users find it a challenge to get started from scratch.

Learn by Example
----------------

New users will most likely find diving into the OpenLayer's example code and experimenting with the library's possible functionality the most useful way to begin.

Browse the Documentation
------------------------

For further information on specific topics, browse the growing collection of OpenLayers  documentation.

 * http://openlayers.org/en/master/doc/quickstart.html
 * http://openlayers.org/en/master/doc/tutorials
 

Find the API Reference
----------------------

After understanding the basic components that make-up and control a map, search the API reference documentation for details on method signatures and object properties.

Join the Community
------------------

OpenLayers is supported and maintained by a community of developers and users like you. Whether you have questions to ask or code to contribute, you can get involved by signing up for the mailing list.

* https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ol3-dev

Reporting issues
----------------
For reporting issues it is important to understand the several flavours in which the OpenLayers library is distributed:

 * ``ol.js`` - the script which is built using the Closure Compiler in advanced mode (not human readable)
 * ``ol-debug.js`` - human readable version to be used during development

When you encounter an issue, it is important to report the issue using ``ol-debug.js``. Also include the full stack trace which you can find using Web Developer tools such as Chrome's Developer Tools. To test this out we are going to make a mistake in map.html by changing ``ol.layer.Tile`` into ``ol.layer.Image``. The error you will see is: ``Uncaught TypeError: Object #<yc> has no method 'tb'``. If you report this to the mailing list, nobody will know what it means. So first, we are going to change the script tag which points to ``ol.js`` to point to ``ol-debug.js`` instead. Reload the page. The debugger will now stop on the error, and we can see the full stack trace:
