OpenLayers 3 Workshop
=====================

Welcome to the **OpenLayers 3 Workshop**. This workshop is designed to
give you a comprehensive overview of ol3 as a web mapping solution.  The
exercises assume that you have an HTTP server running locally and can edit text
files.

This workshop is presented as a set of modules. In each module the reader will
perform a set of tasks designed to achieve a specific goal for that module. Each
module builds upon lessons learned in previous modules and is designed to
iteratively build up the reader's knowledge base.
